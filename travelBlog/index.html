        <p class = "content"> Hi! I'm the TrekChaser, and I'm currently travelling around the world to see what it has to offer! I've wanted to become more 
          immersed with nature as a kid, so I decided to dedicate my life to exploring what this great, big, blue and green rock has in store for us! 
          This is a brand new website, so I don't expect to have a lot of people following me right off the bat. One day though, I hope to build a community 
          that can grow alongside me as I venture into new states and uncharted waters, literally. So far, I've only traveled within territories the U.S. owns, 
          but I aim to travel to other countries one day, specifically Norway, Ireland, or Switzerland! While you're here, feel free to take a look at my blog 
          to see where I've been, learn what I use in the equipment tab, or stop by the photo gallery to see what pictures I've taken. 
          If you'd like, shoot me a message or question in the form down below!</p>
