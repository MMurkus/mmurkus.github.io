          <h2 style="text-align:left;">   Grayson Highlands - 8/7/24</h2>
          <p>   Ah, gool ol' Grayson Highlands. A trip I will always remember, for all the wrong reasons. I first came back here way back in 2007, when I was about 7 or so years old. It was one of my first camping
          trips I've done and the first time I was exposed to the elements. It was cold and cloudy when all 16 of us in my Boy Scout troop gathered around and set off into the forest. Now, at this point, I
          had never been hiking before, so it was brutal to hike up and down, over and over again, for what felt like days (it wasn't, but it sure did feel like it!). After about an hour or so, it started to rain, 
          which is when I learned to check the weather before you plan out a trip. Otherwise, you end up unprotected against what nature can throw at you. It was also where I learned that rain and the cold don't
          really mix well, ever. I didn't get hailed on thankfully, but feeling the cold water on my skin wasn't any better. Someone in my troop ended up breaking their leg during the hike and had to go all the way back
          to where we had started. I felt bad for the kid, but young me saw him as the lucky one of the group.</p><br>
          
          <p>After about two hours, I thought we'd be at the campsite and set up shop, since I was used to short treks to get to campsites. What I didn't know was that this would be an all-day hike, meaning we'd get to our site 
          at the <b>end of the day.</b> At the time, lil' old me was only halfway to the site, meaning we had about three more hours to go before we ended up at our destination, with the possibility of it getting dark
          before we could set up our tents. Looking back, I'm not sure how I had the strength or the will to carry on the trail instead of turning around and wanting to go home. But yet, I kept going, perhaps this is what I was
          meant to do all along!</p><br>

          <p>But at long last, I had made it to the end of the trail, right as it had gotten dark. There was a little bit of a struggle putting our tents together, but everyone was set up and ready to hit the hay before it got too
          dark. My dad did bring some granola bars and apples for me, so that was my dinner for the night. As I went to sleep though, the cold was still getting to me and my sleeping bag, but I didn't know why. Then, I started to feel
          wet. I remember thinking, "did we forget to put the tarp on first!?!", but after a few minutes, I remember my dad helping me lay it out. We did that to prevent water from under the tent getting through the floor, which was 
          very important considering that the rain and cold had not let up. But then, I felt a drop of water on my face, then another, and then, another. To my dismay, my tent had started leaking the cold water on top of me and on the
          floor of my tent, drenching me.</p>
