          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Beech Mountain - 10/21/24</h2>
          <p>It's been about a month since Hurricane Helene hit Western NC, but hearing about the damage in Boone breaks my heart. It's a really lovely town I've visited
            several times in my early days, even snapping a few pictures of the mountains when I was visiting a friend of mine around Lees-McRae College. I've camped here quite
            a lot and know some really cool places, some of which are listed <a style="color:#023020;" target="_blank" href="https://blueridgemountainstravelguide.com/campgrounds-in-boone-nc/"><u>here.</u></a>
          If you want to donate, head to www.samaritanspurse.org and search for Helene on their website, all the money they receive goes straight to those who need it. I know 
          that several "charities" are made to just take your money and run, but this one is legit, I've done my research. I've volunteered to help with the disaster relief at
          Chimney Rock, and the damage is immeasurable. I'll get back to posting my trips soon, but I'm going to where I can put my expertise in nature to use.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Arizona - 9/18/23</h2>
          <p>Just got back from a weeklong trip in Arizona and it. was. amazing! And hot! I doubt I've ever been somewhere where the temperature regularly  goes over 100Â°F, Phoenix really felt like an oven!
          I went all over Arizona during my trip, from Page to Sedona and to Route 66 itself, I loved every inch of the sunshine state. The first hotel I stayed in was GORGEOUS, you can take a look at the gallery to find it, 
          but it had a putput course, the pool, a bar, basically anything a 21 year old could ever want. In fact, I know someone who had their 21st birthday here, it must've been their best birthday! My favorite personally had to 
          be the pink jeep tours. I don't see myself as the kind of person to go offroading too often, since I'm inexperienced at it. My next few favorite things have to be flying over the Grand Canyon and seeing the Horseshoe Bend, 
          they were landmarks I've always wanted to see as a kid! I'm already thinking about returning here one day, but I'll definitely be asking my friend for ideas next time!</p>

          <h2 style="text-align:left;">   Grayson Highlands - 6/5/23</h2>
          <p>   Ah, gool ol' Grayson Highlands. A trip I will always remember, for all the wrong reasons. I first came back here way back in 2007, when I was about 7 or so years old. It was one of my first camping
          trips I've done and the first time I was exposed to the elements. It was cold and cloudy when all 16 of us in my Boy Scout troop gathered around and set off into the forest. Now, at this point, I
          had never been hiking before, so it was brutal to hike up and down, over and over again, for what felt like days. After about an hour or so, it started to rain, 
          which is when I learned to check the weather before you plan out a trip. Otherwise, you end up unprotected against what nature can throw at you. It was also where I learned that rain and the cold don't
          really mix well, ever. I didn't get hailed on thankfully, but feeling the cold water on my skin wasn't any better. Someone in my troop ended up breaking their leg during the hike and had to go all the way back
          to where we had started. I felt bad for the kid, but young me saw him as the lucky one of the group.</p><br>
          
          <p>After about two hours, I thought we'd be at the campsite and set up shop, since I was used to short treks to get to campsites. What I didn't know was that this would be an all-day hike, meaning we'd get to our site 
          at the <b>end of the day.</b> At the time, lil' old me was only halfway to the site, meaning we had about three more hours to go before we ended up at our destination, with the possibility of it getting dark
          before we could set up our tents. Looking back, I'm not sure how I had the strength or the will to carry on the trail instead of turning around and wanting to go home. But yet, I kept going, perhaps this is what I was
          meant to do all along!</p><br>

          <p>But at long last, I had made it to the end of the trail, right as it had gotten dark. There was a little bit of a struggle putting our tents together, but everyone was set up and ready to hit the hay before it got too
          dark. My dad did bring some granola bars and apples for me, so that was my dinner for the night. As I went to sleep though, the cold was still getting to me and my sleeping bag, but I didn't know why. Then, I started to feel
          wet. I remember thinking, "did we forget to put the tarp on first!?!", but after a few minutes, I remember my dad helping me lay it out. We did that to prevent water from under the tent getting through the floor, which was 
          very important considering that the rain and cold had not let up. But then, I felt a drop of water on my face, then another, and then, another. To my dismay, my tent had started leaking the cold water on top of me and on the
          floor of my tent, drenching me. Then came the shivering, and with it, probably the longest night in my entire life. I swear, I felt every second of those eight hours.</p><br>

          <p>But I had survived, mostly because I went to my dad's tent to get away from my leaking tent. We conserved body heat by sleeping next to each other, which helped with the cold. By the time the sun rose, everyone in the troop
          collectively agreed to head back down a day early because of the weather. It was a bit difficult to work our way down the mountain, considering the fog was blocking our vision, but we made it all the way down without any more injuries
          from the last 14 people. I swear, I've never been more happy to see the bus or any bus in my entire life. On the ride back, me and my dad talked about the trip and he had told me that my lips were blue when I came into his tent, which
            was a sign of hypothermia. There wasn't any necessary medication I had to take and it was thankfully just my lips, but to think it could've been worse just goes to show how important bringing the right equipment is. Now that I'm thinking
            about it, I should create a separate page with what I currently use. For now, this is the end of my very first blog post, hope you all enjoyed!</p>
