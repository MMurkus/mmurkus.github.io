       <h2>CSC-1210: Nature Blog</h2>
        <p>For our final project in this course, we were instructed to come up with an idea for a website and build it from scratch using everything we've learned in 
        the class. Each student had to come up with an idea and work alone to build it from the ground up. I chose to go with a nature blog because I've travelled to 
        a few places like Arizona and the Virgin Islands over the past few years. These trips also included some of my personal stories that shows my perspective and
        how I grew from these events and what I took away from them. You can view the webpage by clicking <a class="plain" href="https://mmurkus.github.io/travelBlog/" target="_blank">here!</a> 
        Do note that the form doesn't send a response, since we used it to demonstrate our knowledge of JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>CSC-1210: Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>Fun Fact: The website you're viewing right now was also made in this course! Using fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we created a rough draft 
        during a class test and buit up on what we've learned throughout the semester. Like the custom website, this was also a solo project and we had to do this on
        our own. We first started out with creating a color palette to use, which is displayed in the footer below. From there, we added external style sheets, fonts, and text
        shadows to our pages. I've also learned BootStrap from this course and aim to renovate my portfolio in the near future!</p>

        <h2>GAM-2252: Rap Off</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team of three to create a card game for our second project in this class. The idea behind it is similar to how <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> is played. Players draw three cards
        and must make a rap out of them within two minutes, then all of the players not rapping must vote on who had the best rap in the round. I collaborated on coming up with some of
        the cards, but I mostly printed out <a class="plain" href="pictures/rapOffCards.jpg" target="_blank">the cards</a>, physically put them together, and used Canva to write and design the <a class="plain" href="pictures/rapOffDaRules.png" target="_blank">rules</a> of the game. I also suggested the idea of creating a 
        <a class="plain" href="pictures/rapOffBox.jpg" target="_blank">cardbord box</a> to hold everything that was required to play and integrating cards from <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> into the game in <a class="plain" href="pictures/rapOffXtraRulz.png" target="_blank">another sheet of rules.</a></p>

        <h2>GAM-2252: Stormsailers</h2>
        <p>For our first project in this course, we were instructed to create a board game within the span of four weeks. Working in a group of four, we created a prototype of <a class="plain" href="pictures/stormsailersBoard.jpg" target="_blank">Stormsailers</a>, 
          a game that can have 2-4 players play simutaneously. The game involves each player moving around the board and collecting the wooden pieces on the map, called treasure tokens. Once the player collects a certain amount, they can move to 1 of the 4
        islands and collect a gem, which they must move back to the middle of the board (a.k.a. the eye of the storm) to win. Along the way, players can land on spaces labeled M or M2 to draw 1 or 2 mystery cards,
        respectively. These cards can either be <a class="plain" href="pictures/stormsailersPlayCards.jpg" target="_blank">play cards</a> that can be used at any time or <a class="plain" href="pictures/stormsailersEffectCards.jpg" target="_blank">effect cards</a> 
        that happen immediately and usually rotate a ring on the board or place a black turbulence token on the board, which players can't pass through. I was responsible for coming up with the turbulence mechanic, 
        creating cards like Boarding Party and Changing Course, and creating the rules for our game.</p>
