       <h2>CSC-1210: Custom Website</h2>
        <p>For our final project in this course, we were instructed to come up with an idea for a website and build it from scratch using everything we've learned in 
        the class. Each student had to come up with an idea and work alone to build it from the ground up. I chose to go with a nature blog because I've travelled to 
        a few places like Arizona and the Virgin Islands over the past few years. You can view my webpage by clicking <a class="plain" href="https://mmurkus.github.io/travelBlog/" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

        <h2>CSC-1210: Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>Fun Fact: The website you're viewing right now was also made in this course! Using fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS, we started by creating a rough draft 
        during a class test and building up on what we've learned throughout the semester as time went on. Like the custom website, this was also a solo project and we had to do this on
        our own. I've also learned BootStrap from this course and aim to renovate my portfolio in the near future.</p>

        <h2>GAM-2252: Rap Off</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team of three to create a card game for our second project in this class. The idea behind it is similar to how <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> is played. Players draw three cards
        and must make a rap out of them within two minutes, then all of the players not rapping must vote on who had the best rap in the round. I collaborated on coming up with some of
        the cards, but mostly worked on writing the rules of the game, printing the cards, and physically putting them together. I also suggested the idea of creating a cardbord boombox to 
        hold everything that was required to play.</p>

        <h2>GAM-2252: Stormsailers</h2>
        <p>For our first project in this course, we were instructed to create a board game within the span of four weeks. Working in a group of four, we created a game that can have 2-4 players play
        W.I.P.</p>
